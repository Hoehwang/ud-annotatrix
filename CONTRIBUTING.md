# Greetings!

Hi, if you're reading this file you probably like Annotatrix and want to contribute.
That's great! We are always looking for people who want to join us in making a great
tool for annotating Universal Dependencies. In this file we'll give some advice 
for how to contribute and some norms in the project.

# General stuff

* Find a bug? Submit an issue! We'll try and get to it as quickly as possible. This also
   goes for feature requests.
* Pull requests wanted! If you fork the repo and want to make a pull request, that's great,
   just do it, no need to ask.
* Getting direct commit access... if you think direct commit access would be easier, then 
   contact us, we're very open to new contributions.

# Coding style

Right now the code is a bit... diverse, but in the future we're planning to follow these
guidelines.

* We use four-space indentation
* Global variables are all in capitals, with underscores for spacing
* For other variables and functions we use camelCase
* Spaces between binary operators and operands 
* Each function should be documented in JSDoc style
* Braces go on the same line
* Use semicolons at the end of statements
* Use var for local variables
